              The root of all music. You will learn about counting in time, a
              crucial skill for any musician. By the end of this section, you
              will be able to write drum patterns in MIDI. You will be provided
              with a Bitwig Drum Machine preset to work with, and focus only on
              writing rhythms.

                  Beyond just being a measure of speed, it is also a measure of
                  energy. Combined with time signature, the perception of speed
                  can be manipulated greatly, without ever changing tempo. You
                  will explore working in different tempos, and will learn the
                  average tempo ranges for many genres. By the end of this
                  section, you will be able to find the tempo of any track.

                      Music is the manipulation of sounds in structured and
                      pleasant ways over the passage of time. Therefore, we must
                      first understand music's relationship with time. Tempo is
                      measured is Beats Per Minute, or BPM. This is simply a
                      count of the beats in a minute. In simpler terms, how many
                      times you tap your foot to the rhythm in one minute.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      For example, 120 BPM is equivalent to 2 beats per second.
                      This establishes the pace. Here are some examples of
                      tempo, counted in 4 seconds for brevity. Multiplying the
                      amount of beats by 15 (because 1min = 60s / 4s = 15) gives
                      you the BPM.

                  Music that never repeats is not music. Time signature defines
                  the rules and structure of your track, as well as the measure
                  of musical time which the repetition, or loop, will be built
                  around. By the end of this section you will be able to count
                  any 4/4 track (most music is in 4/4), and have the
                  understanding to explore other time signatures.

                  You will apply the concepts of tempo and time signature
                  through learning common drum patterns in some genres of your
                  choice, as well as writing your own. You will also learn about
                  breaks, which are crucial to create and release tension in
                  your music. By the end of this section, you will have a few
                  patterns written that are building blocks for a track.

                  At this point your patterns will feel and sound robotic. You
                  will learn how to humanize them through velocity. When a
                  musician plays anything, they never hit a note or drum exactly
                  the same twice in a row, there is always some slight
                  variation. You will recreate this through manual velocity
                  editing, as well a modulation based velocity variation. By the
                  end of this section, you will have humanized the patterns you
                  created earlier.

                  represented in many different ways as you accent different
                  notes. By the end of this section, you will have a complete
                  set of patterns with multiple variations to build a track

            <p>
              While rhythm is the motion in music, melody is the voice. Music is
              an abstract language that conveys emotions and mind states.
              Learning to write melodies is the equivalent of learning to speak
              as a child; you will go from making noise, to expressing yourself
              more and more eloquently with time.

                  Music is expressed through the relationship between notes.
                  Your musical expression is defined by your movement through
                  the notes, and the distances between them. This is melody at
                  it's simplest. By the end of this section, you will have the
                  foundational understanding necessary to begin learning scales,
                  which represent the spectrum of musical expression.

                  This is the core foundation melody and harmony. Playing a
                  scale is essentially limiting the notes you can play to a set
                  of rules defined by cultures, musicians, religions, etc. all
                  throughout time. There 24,576 possible scales, in case you
                  were curious. By the end of this section, you will have
                  written a melody in a Bitwig MIDI clip, using provided
                  instrument presets.

            <p>
              A melody, be it looping or evolving, is expression of a story or
              emotion, and therefore requires context. The same melody can
              present different nuances of expression based on its context.
              Harmony is what contextualizes the melody. Of course, it can also
              work the other way around, where melody contextualizes harmony.
              This is all up to the producer. By the end of this section, you
              will have fleshed out a melody by adding an accompanying bassline
              and chords.

                  The bassline is the glue between rhythm and harmony. You will
                  learn about its relationship with each and write your own
                  basslines to accompany your melodies. This is further solidify
                  your understanding of melody and harmony, and circle back to
                  the rhythm section as we begin to merge the two.

                  Chords breathe life into music, and are fundamental to any
                  track. I can think of many tracks without rhythm, with no
                  discerning melody, but never without chords. You will learn to
                  build chords from your melody and vice versa. You will also
                  learn about chord progressions, write your own, and write
                  melodies on top of them. By the end of this section, the
                  musical part of the course will be complete, and you will have
                  your own set of clips to build a track with.
